# Virp
 Virp (VIRtual cell generation by Permutation) is a code for the fast generation of a virtual cell from a crystal structure (in CIF format) containing site disorder. It is named after Singapore's first superhero, VR Man, whose superpower is "Virping". The TV show was dogwater; we are still proud of him though.
